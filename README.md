# DeepSTARR
Here is the code used to train DeepSTARR and to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript:

## Genome-wide enhancer activity maps of developmental and housekeeping enhancers
We used UMI-STARR-seq (Arnold et al., 2013; Neumayr et al., 2019) to generate genome-wide high resolution, quantitative activity maps of developmental and housekeeping enhancers, representing the two main transcriptional programs in Drosophila S2 cells (Arnold et al., 2017; Haberle et al., 2019; Zabidi et al., 2015).
